// There are basically 4 types of smart pointers :
// 1. Shared PTR
// 2. Unique PTR
// 3. Weak PTR
// 4. Auto PTR

// Auto PTR has been removed or is being cancelled
// weak PTR is a version or a kind of shared PTR

// Unique PTR : it is used when a particular resouce has only an exclusive ownership and it has to be used by others who does not have that resource ownership
// Shared PTR : it is used when a particular resource has to be used by more than one object
